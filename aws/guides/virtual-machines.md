# Virtual machines

You can create the EC2 instance from DuploCloud. Go to **DevOps** > **Hosts** > **EC2** > **+Add** button above the table. Choose the desired instance type. The available instance types are set by your administrator or the plan you choose in DuploCloud. If you are not using this host for hosting containers, then set the pool as none. If you want a public IP for the host, then select the public subnet in the list of availability zones.
