# Quick Start - using ECS Services

In this guide, we will deploy a web application using ECS Fargate.

The steps involved in the setup will be:

* Use the Infrastructure created in  [Step1](../step-1-infrastructure.md) and [Step2](../step-2-tenant.md) in the quickstart guide.
* Create a Task Definition.
* Create a micro-service called webapp with the docker image as https:latest
* Expose the webapp using a loadbalancer and Test it.
