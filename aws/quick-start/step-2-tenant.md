# Step 2: Tenant

Once the Infrastructure is created, then create a new Tenant (Administrator --> Tenants). Give the name as dev01 and choose plan as non-prod (the same name as the infrastructure we just created). You just need 2 inputs

* Name: dev01
* Plan: non-prod

It may take about 1-2 minutes for the Tenant to be setup. During this time there maybe an additional fault under Administrator-->Faults or top right. If so ignore it for first 2 minutes, it should clear
