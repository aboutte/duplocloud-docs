# Quick Start

This QuickStart tutorial guides the end-to-end deployment flow from creating infrastructure to deploying a web application using DuploCloud portal.

This guide will help you to follow listed steps:

* [Create Infrastructure](step-1-infrastructure.md): This sets up the VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Routes, Kubernetes Cluster and ECS.
* [Create a Tenant](step-2-tenant.md):  Please read [here ](../../getting-started/application-focussed-interface/tenant.md)for Tenant Concept.
* DuploCloud supports three container orchestration technologies to deploy containerized applications in AWS - EKS, ECS Fargate, and a built-in Container orchestration. Follow the below links for the walk-through:
  * [Using K8s Service](quick-start-eks-services/)
  * [Using ECS Service](quick-start-ecs-services/)
  * [Using Docker Native Service](quick-start-duplocloud-docker-services/)
