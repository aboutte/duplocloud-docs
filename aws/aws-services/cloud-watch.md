# Cloud watch

By default, the metrics for a resource are available in the Metrics page in DuploCloud. But some metrics need agents to be installed in the system to collect the information, such as AWS Agent. DuploCloud provides a way to automatically install these agents on all the hosts whenever they are provisioned. For more information, refer to [agent modules](https://portal.duplocloud.net/compliance/Implementation.html?\_\_hstc=199910065.5cb100958892546d1fc484f311cab1cc.1640799817379.1643935000925.1643939246257.67&\_\_hssc=199910065.5.1643939246257&\_\_hsfp=29941011#agent-modules) in compliance controls and security frameworks[.](https://portal.duplocloud.net/compliance/Implementation.html?\_\_hstc=199910065.5cb100958892546d1fc484f311cab1cc.1640799817379.1643935000925.1643939246257.67&\_\_hssc=199910065.5.1643939246257&\_\_hsfp=29941011#agent-modules)
