# Central logging

All the activity in the DuploCloud is logged which can be used for auditing. All the logs are saved into Elasticsearch and can be visualized in Kibana. The URL for the Kibana is available under Diagnostics.

Elasticsearch & Kibana are hosted within the VPC and cannot be accessed from outside of the VPC. Connect to the VPN and access these URLs.
