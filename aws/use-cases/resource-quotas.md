# Resource Quotas

An Administrator can define Quotas for resource allocation in a DuploCloud Plan. Resource allocation can be restricted via Instance Family and Size. An administrator can restrict the total number of allowed resources by setting **Cumulative Count** value per Resource type.&#x20;

\
Once the Quota is defined, DuploCloud users are restricted to create new resources when the corresponding quota configured in Plan is reached.
