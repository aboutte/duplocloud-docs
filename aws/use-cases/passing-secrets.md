# Passing secrets

Passing secrets to the Docker based service/ Lambda function can be done using environmental variables. For example, you can create a SQL database from the **DevOps > Database > RDS** tab in DuploCloud, provide username and password, then in the Lambda menu give the same username and password. No secrets need to be stored anywhere outside like vault, git, repo, etc.
