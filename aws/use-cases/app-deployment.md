# App Deployment

Applications can be of many forms. DuploCloud supports following types:

* [Dockerized apps](../container-orchestration.md): This constitute today 90% of our user workloads. The platform orchestrates containerized app deployments using EKS, ECS Fargate or a built-in container orchestration system as defined in the [previous section](../container-orchestration.md)
* [Lambda Functions](../aws-services/lambda.md)
* EMR Workloads
* AWS Batch
* Sage maker
* Glue&#x20;
