# Security and Compliance

Compliance and security is DuploCloud's bread-and-butter. The core approach is out-of-box compliance where the users don't have to explicitly learn and apply compliance controls. Following are some of the white papers on how DuploCloud implements security and compliance

* [PCI and HIPAA Compliance](https://duplocloud.com/white-papers/pci-and-hipaa-compliance-with-duplocloud/)
* [SOC 2 Compliance](https://duplocloud.com/white-papers/soc-2-compliance-with-duplocloud/)&#x20;
