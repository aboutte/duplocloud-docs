# Step 2: Tenant

Once the Infrastructure is created, then create a new Tenant (Administrator --> Tenants). Give the name as dev01 and choose **p** (the same name as the infrastructure we just created). You just need 2 inputs

* Name: dev01
* Plan: nonprod

It may take about 1-2 minutes for the Tenant to be set up. During this time there may be an additional fault under Administrator-->Faults or top right. If so ignore it for the first 2 minutes, it should clear.
