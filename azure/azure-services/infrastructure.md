# Infrastructure

A completely new isolated environment can be created from DuploCloud. Proceed to **Admin > Infrastructure**. Click on the **+button**. It opens a form where it asks the Administrator to enter basic information about the new environment that is needed.

Follow [these steps](../quick-start/step-1-infrastructure.md) to create a New Infrastructure.

DuploCloud will create a VNET with a default subnet and a default NSG. Creation of the Infrastructure takes around 10 mins. Once the Infrastructure is complete it comes to a Ready state. A plan with the same name will be created for this Infrastructure. This plan can be further used for the creation of tenants.
