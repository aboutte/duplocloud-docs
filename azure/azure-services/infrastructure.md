DuploCloud will create a VNET with a default subnet and a default NSG. Creation of the Infrastructure takes around 10 mins. Once the Infrastructure is complete it comes to Ready state. A plan with the same name will be created for this Infrastructure. This plan can be used for creation of the tenants.
